## Netflix-SingUp
A clone of the Netflix signup page but added some new features--Includes functionality to show or hide a password input field using an eye icon. It also integrates validation to detect if the input field is empty, an error message will occur.

## Project Describution
Developed a sign-up page inspired by Netflix. It's enjoyable to replicate a website, even if it's just a single sign-up page. When clicking "Next" without entering any information into the input field, a red error message will be displayed. The eye logo allows users to toggle the visibility of the password.
